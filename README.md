An anodyne, charismatic and an edgy-style image gallery which i built with the HTML and the CSS .
The gallery features a simple but alluring theme in an inline-block



## Project description

This project is a layout that is designed to be alluring . 
This project explains a brief overview of my interests,
it has a character which i classify it as a brainrot since its a funny fictional character in an anime, jujutsu kaisen.
It also talks about astronomy.
Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects, space and the universe s a whole i just likke how it explains the origins ,evolution and physical properties of obejects beyond earth
such as stars, planets, moons, galaxies, black holes and one of my favorites which are Nebulas. I actually think nebulas are so alluring
a good example is the butterfly nebula and the eye nebula.
